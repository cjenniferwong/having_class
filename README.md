# having_class
figuring out if you need to write a class or function

# Tech used and things that I learned:
- regex
    I should really learn the nomenclature so that I can decipher posts and find the answer to my questions
- APIs
    I learned to use the requests library and put things into the body/headers
- having class
    I learned to better differentiate when to write classes and when to write function
