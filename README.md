# having_class
figuring out if you need to write a class or function

## Outline:
1. need to know what company you're interested in
2. need to know the settings that are unique to that company to manipulate the data
3. return the jobs based on the parameters specified (pretty v csv)


# Tech used and things that I learned:
- regex
    I should really learn the nomenclature so that I can decipher posts and find the answer to my questions
- APIs
    I learned to use the requests library and put things into the body/headers
- having class
    I learned to better differentiate when to write classes and when to write function
- working with edge-cases and exceptions, and what-ifs
